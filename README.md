# Relevance-Prediction
Predict the relevance of a result with respect to a query  

### Introduction  
The area of text analytics (or text mining) includes techniques from multitude scientific
areas (A.I., statistics, linguistics), and it has a wide range of applications (security, marketing, information
retrieval, opinion mining). While structured data are “ready” for analysis and evaluation, unstructured text
requires transformation in order to uncover the underlying information. The transformation of unstructured
text into a structured set of data is not a straight forward task and text analytics offers a wide variety of tools
to tackle with the idioms, ambiguities and irregularities of natural language.  

### Dataset Description  
There are three datasets available. The first one, train.csv, contains pairs of queries and
answers and also contains the relevance score. The second dataset is product_descriptions.csv, and for each different product it contains a textual description of the product. The third file, attributes.csv, contains additional attributes for some of the products (some products may not contain additional attributes).
